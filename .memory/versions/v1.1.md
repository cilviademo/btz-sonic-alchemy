# Version v1.1

## Major Features
- JUCE plugin target formalized via `juce_add_plugin(... FORMATS VST3 ...)`.
- Reliable Windows x64 build script added.
- One-step build+install script added.
- Installer corrected for VST3 bundle copy behavior.

## Architectural State
- Build source of truth: `btz-sonic-alchemy-main/BTZ/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Current JUCE source dependency path:
  - `C:/Users/marcm/OneDrive/Desktop/JUCE-8.0.6`

## Known Risks
- Hardcoded local dependency paths.
- Script assumptions tied to current nested repo layout.

## Performance Status
- Build/install stability improved.
- Runtime host performance validation in progress.
